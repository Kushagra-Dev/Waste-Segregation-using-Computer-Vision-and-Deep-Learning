# Waste Classification Project

This repository contains code for training a waste classification model using PyTorch and a ResNet-18 architecture. It includes scripts for dataset splitting, preprocessing images, and training the model with logging support via TensorBoard.

## Project Structure

- `dataset_split.py` - Script to split a raw dataset into train, validation, and test subsets by class.
- `preprocessing.py` - Script to preprocess images (resize, normalize, convert to tensors) and save as PyTorch tensors.
- `train.py` - Script to train a ResNet-18 model on the preprocessed dataset.
- `processed_train/`, `processed_val/`, `processed_test/` - Preprocessed tensor datasets generated by `preprocessing.py`.
- `dataset_split/` - Dataset directory structured into train/val/test folders organized by class.
- `model.pth` - Saved trained model weights.
